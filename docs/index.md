UMarkdown is a utility library for parsing and converting Markdown text
into Unity compatible rich text and UI elements.

UMarkdown uses the widely used
[Markdig](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig) library for parsing Markdown syntax as
well as [ColorCode](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/ColorCode-Universal) for syntax
highlighting of code blocks (planned to be replaced in the future)
